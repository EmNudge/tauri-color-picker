# Color Picker - Tauri

This is somewhat of a clone of a favorite application of mine, previously made in electron:
https://www.electronjs.org/apps/colorpicker

I grew upset with the app's size, startup, and ram usage, so I've been searching for a replacement for a while now. Tauri seems to be the way to go.

This project is nowhere near done. This README will be updated with time.
